## Requirements ##

To try cl-Jupyter you need :

 - a Common lisp implementation, for now

   - either SBCL 1.2.x or above (with native threads enabled)

   - or Clozure CL 1.10 or aboce (with native threads enabled) ...

   - ECL is planned, for other implementations please fill an issue.

 - Quicklisp (cf. http://www.quicklisp.org/)

 - Python 3.2 or above

 - IPython 3.0 or above

## Quick install ##

Please run the installation script :

    python3 ./install-cl-jupyter.py

By default, cl-Jupyter assumes SBCL as the default lisp implementation. Using CCL instead requires
the following command line:

    python3 ./install-cl-jupyter.py  --lisp=ccl

**Note**: cl-Jupyter seems to work better with CCL on MacOS  (but on Linux everything's fine with SBCL).

## Running cl-jupyter

### Console mode

    ipython3 console --no-secure --kernel=lisp

**Remark**: the `--no-secure` option is for the moment required because cl-jupyter
does not yet support message encryption.

### Notebooks

The real interest of cl-Jupyter is its use conjointly
 with the Jupyter notebook frontend. For a try, type:

    ipython3 notebook --Session.key="b''" --kernel=lisp


The file [about-cl-jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/fredokun/cl-jupyter/blob/master/about-cl-jupyter.ipynb) is an example of a Lisp-based notebook.

The file [about-cl-jupyter.pdf](https://github.com/fredokun/cl-jupyter/blob/master/about-cl-jupyter.pdf) is a printable PDF version of this notebook that can be generated by the Jupyter `nbconvert` tool.
